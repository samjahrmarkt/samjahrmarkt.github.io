My name is Sam Jahrmarkt, and I am a freshman at Lehigh University. I am currently a math major who is eager to learn more about the applications of data journalism. Outside of school, I enjoy running in my neighborhood and singing both alone and with my acapella group. I opted to take this class because it was an interesting ammolgamation of my interests: statistics, coding, and writing.

<b>Voter Turnout By Age</b>

Overall voter turnout rates provided on this site cannot reveal who among the electorate voted, therefore, the voter turnout data publicized was provided through surveys (census). The United States Elections represented on their website voter turnout demographics in the past few elections through individual line graphs. I was especially interested in comparing the age turnout in the primary and general elections. I anticapated low percantage turnouts in Gen Z, yet, I did not expect the 11% difference in voter turnout between the two elections. Conversely, voter turnout for citizens 60+ was extremely high and differed less between the two elections (8% difference). This data begs an important question for the upcoming election; will voter turnout stick to this trend or will national uproar propell participation in this election.

NBCUniversal Media, the American mass media and entertainment conglomerate owned by Comcast, began its industry takeover in 1910. The network has transformed as media has evolved through dedication and innovation. Whether it was colorizing their media or transitioning from TV to radio, NBC consistently revolutionized the industry, setting the bar high for other platforms of entertainment.

Most Populated Countries 

![population](https://github.com/samjahrmarkt/samjahrmarkt.github.io/blob/master/population.png?raw=true)

The U.S. Census Bureau displays the nations with the highest populations as of July 1st, 2020. Dominating the first and second of this list are China and India with 1,394,015,977 and 1,326,093,247, respectively. United States distantly follows with 329,877,505 people. The Census is mandated by the Constitution and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau; everyone living in the United States is required by law to be counted in the 2020 Census. Though the site does not explicitly describe the method at which they recieved this data in other nations, one could assume its a similar method of formation. The U.S. population clock is based on a series of short-term projections for the resident population of the United States.

Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index

![nasa](https://github.com/samjahrmarkt/samjahrmarkt.github.io/blob/master/nasa.png?raw=true)

This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature from 2000 to 2019 according to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The dots display the annual mean temperature while the dark blue line exhibits the lowess smoothing line: the line through a timeplot or scatter plot to more clearly display the relationship between two variables. The line graph shows the gradual increase of the global land-ocean temperature starting from .4째C in 2000 to .99째C in 2019. Although the general trend of global temperature is a gradual increase, the year 2016 ranks as the warmest on record; the annual mean of 2016 reaches 1.02째C, which is higher than the global surface temperature 2019 (.99째C).

This map, created with google maps, represents the 10 most visited national parks in 2019, according to the National Park Service. Within one year, the national parks had a total of 327,516,619 recreation visits. The National Park Service oversees over 400 national parks across the country, all of which containing different shapes, sizes, and purpose. This map includes all parks that are administered by the US Government, thus many of these landmarks are not traditionally considered "parks": parkways and monuments. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area was the most visited park in 2019, holding 15 million recreational visits.

Both bar charts display data from a survey conducted on Lehigh students regarding their social lives. The "Party Location" graph represents the male and female breakdown of party location preferences. The survey conveyed that females prefer off campus parties, while males prefer fraternity houses. Females are 6.95% more likely to have no preference as to where they party. The disparity between top two choices is significantly larger in females than males (15.06% and 4.63%, respectively). The "Safety Conditions at Lehigh by Gender" graph represents unsafe conditions at Lehigh parties for both females and males. It is less likely for students to feel unsafe at Lehigh parties, yet the data showed that males are more likely to experience these unsafe conditions. 

Metrics for Hotspot States from June 14 to June 28, 2020

These two graphs represent  metrics for hotspot states from June 14 to June 28, 2020 according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The first focuses on the positivity rate while the other centers around hospitilization rates. While four of the states are reporting fewer than 40 daily cases, 16 are reporting 400 or more new cases per day, and nine states have positivity rates above 10%. Though correlated, a state with a high positivity rate does not necessarily mean hospitalization rates will be high as well. For example, California with a relatively low positivity rate of 6%, their rolling average number of hospitalizations was the highest of any hotspot state at 60. This disparity is mainly because of California's high population; positivity rate is a percentage therefore is taking into account population size whereas hospitalization rates is a rolling number.
