In Fall 2019, the Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analysis, publicized data regarding undergraduate residence at Lehigh University. It displayed that the vast majority of undergraduate students live either in residence halls (48.3%) or off-campus (38.7%). The remaining 13% is represented through greek life housing. I find this data to be pretty well represented within the Lehigh community and, though more specific, is around what my estimate of undergraduate residence would look like. The residential gender break down was also extremely true to Lehigh's total population of male and female students, 55% and 45%, respectively. For example, out of the 2500 students who live in residence halls, the male population is only four students away from being exactly 55%. Therefore, there is no skew in the percentage of students in each residential area.
