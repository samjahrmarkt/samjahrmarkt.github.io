My name is Sam Jahrmarkt, and I am a freshman at Lehigh University. I am currently a math major who is eager to learn more about the applications of data journalism. Outside of school, I enjoy running in my neighborhood and singing both alone and with my acapella group. I opted to take this class because it was an interesting ammolgamation of my interests: statistics, coding, and writing. 

Lehigh Undergraduate Residence

In Fall 2019, the Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analysis, publicized data regarding undergraduate residence at Lehigh University. It displayed that the majority of undergraduate students live either in residence halls (48.3%) or off-campus (38.7%). The remaining 13% is represented through greek life housing. I find this data to be pretty well represented within the Lehigh community and, though more specific, is around what my estimate of undergraduate residence would look like. The residential gender break down was also extremely true to Lehigh's total population of male and female students, 55% and 45%, respectively. For example, out of the 2500 students who live in residence halls, the male population is only four students away from being exactly 55%. Therefore, there is no skew in the percentage of students in each residential area.

Overall voter turnout rates provided on this site cannot reveal who among the electorate voted, therefore, the voter turnout data publicized was provided through surveys (census). The United States Elections represented on their website voter turnout demographics in the past few elections through individual line graphs. I was especially interested in comparing the age turnout in the primary and general elections. I anticapated low percantage turnouts in Gen Z, yet, I did not expect the 11% difference in voter turnout between the two elections. Conversely, voter turnout for citizens 60+ was extremely high and differed less between the two elections (8% difference). This data begs an important question for the upcoming election; will voter turnout stick to this trend or will national uproar propell participation in this election.

The timeline displays the story of Lehigh and Lafayette's notorious rivalry. Beginning in 1884, the first game sparked immediate tension with Lafayette winning 50-0. The rivalry continues to today with our team's being competetive as ever; even through zoom. Though all scheduled games were cancelled in 2020, the teams still managed to meet through zoom, exhibiting Le-Laf's undying bond for about 150 years.
